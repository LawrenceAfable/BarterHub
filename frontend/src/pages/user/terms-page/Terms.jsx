        </p>

        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          BarterHub is an online platform designed to facilitate the exchange
          of items and goods between individuals, based on a barter system—
          i.e., without any monetary exchange. By using BarterHub, you agree to
          participate in the barter exchange in a fair and respectful manner.
        </p>

        <h3>2. User Registration and Account Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>2.1</strong> To use BarterHub, you must first create an account. You agree to provide accurate and complete information during the registration process and to update it if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.2</strong> You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>2.3</strong> We take your privacy seriously. Your personal information will only be used in accordance with our <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. How Bartering Works</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>3.1</strong> BarterHub allows users to list items they wish to trade with others, in exchange for items they need or desire.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.2</strong> Once you find an item you’re interested in, you can express your interest by “liking” the item. If both parties express interest in each other's items, the system facilitates further communication through the integrated messaging tool.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>3.3</strong> <em>Transaction Process:</em> Once a trade is agreed upon, the exchange of goods should take place either in person or via agreed-upon shipping. BarterHub does not facilitate the actual exchange of items but merely provides a platform for users to connect and negotiate trades.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Item Listings and Trade Rules</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>4.1</strong> You are solely responsible for the items you post on BarterHub, including the legality and condition of those items. Items should be clearly described, including any defects or issues that may affect the trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.2</strong> BarterHub reserves the right to remove any items or accounts that violate these terms or that are reported as illegal or harmful.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>4.3</strong> Trades should be made fairly, and we encourage transparency during negotiations. Any disputes that arise between users should be resolved independently, and BarterHub is not responsible for the outcome of any exchanges.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Security of Transactions</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>5.1</strong> <em>Communication Security:</em> All communication between users on the platform is encrypted and protected. However, we recommend that users take necessary precautions when exchanging personal information outside of the platform.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.2</strong> <em>Safety in Trade:</em> Users are advised to meet in safe, public locations when exchanging goods in person. BarterHub does not take responsibility for any accidents, injuries, or disputes that occur during the exchange process.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.3</strong> <em>User Verification:</em> Users are encouraged to verify the identity of the person they are trading with. BarterHub may implement additional verification methods to ensure the security of the community.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>5.4</strong> <em>Third-Party Services:</em> BarterHub is not responsible for any third-party services (e.g., shipping companies) used in the transaction process. Always ensure you are dealing with reputable services.
